Windows Azure Resource Provider SDK
===
Looking to become a seller in the [Windows Azure Store](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/overview/)? Then you have found the right place to start. This SDK describes how to write a web service that allows users to purchase your offering from the Windows Azure Store and manage it from the Windows Azure Management Portal.

Where do I start?
---
There are two big pieces to onboarding to the Store. First, we work with you to evaluate if your service is a good fit for the Store:

1. Explore the [Windows Azure Store](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/overview/) and the types of offers available in it.
2. If you think your offering should be available in the Store, [tell us why](mailto:wastorepartners@microsoft.com) and we will get back to you shortly.

If your service is approved for the Store, we begin technical integration:

1. Write your Resource Provider. Follow the [API documentation](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/concepts.md) to do this.
2. Register your Resource Provider and offering details in the [Publisher Portal](http://publish.marketplace.windowsazure.com). Read the [Publisher Portal Guide](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/publisher-portal.md) to do this.
3. We will test your RP in staging, and enable it in production once it passes our tests.
