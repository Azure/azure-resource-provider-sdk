#Add-on Branding Guide

We want to make your offering look as attractive as possible in the Azure Store. Please follow these guidelines as you develop your logos.

> Our designers can work with you to create logos that meet the requirements in this guide. > Please e-mail us your logo in EPS or PSD format at <wastorepartners@microsoft.com>

##Logo Sizes
We need three logo sizes for your offering:

* 45x45 pixels
* 100x100 pixels
* 215x215 pixels

These logos will be uploaded to the [Publisher Portal Guide](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/publisher-portal.md).


##Logo Look and Feel

* The Azure design has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
* Logos should not be placed on a white background. We recommend simple primary colors or transparent backgrounds.
* **Do not use a gradient background** on the logo.
* Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. 
* The look and feel of your logo should be 'flat' and should avoid gradients.

##Use of the Azure logo
