Brand Guide
===
We want to make your offering look as attractive as possible in the Windows Azure Store. Please follow these guidelines as you develop your logos.

> Our designers can work with you to create logos that meet the requirements in this guide. > Please e-mail us your logo in EPS or PSD format at <wastorepartners@microsoft.com>

Logo sizes
---
We need three logo sizes for your offering:

* 45x45 pixels
* 100x100 pixels
* 215x215 pixels


Logo look and feel
---
* The Windows Azure has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
* Logos should not be placed on a white background. We recommend simple primary colors.
* **Do not use a gradient background** on the logo.
* Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. Generally, symbols and picturs are greatly preferred to text.
* The look and feel of your logo should be 'flat' and should avoid gradients.
