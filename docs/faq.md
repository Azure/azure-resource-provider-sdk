## How do I update my Add-on logos displayed on the Azure website? 
As of December 2013 we support higher resolution Add-on logos on Azure Store pages.  To update your Add-on logos you will need to log into the [Publisher Portal](http://publish.windowsazure.com).  If you are not using the new Publisher Portal you will need to upgrade by following the steps in "How do I upgrade to the new Publisher Portal?".

1. Log into the [Publisher Portal](http://publish.windowsazure.com).
2. Select the vertical tab "App Services"
3. Select your Add-on
4. Select the horizontal tab “Marketing”
5. Select “English” or other language where relevant
6. Upload your new logos

## How do I upgrade to the new Publisher Portal?
If you launched your Add-on into the Azure Store before October 2013, you are most likely on the older version of the Azure Publisher Portal.  Our new Publisher Portal supports additional option to configure your Add-on and plans, and at some point all Add-ons will need to be migrated to the new Publisher Portal.

The new Publisher Portal is located at http://publish.windowsazure.com.  Follow the [Publisher Portal Guide](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/publisher-portal.md) to get started with the new Publisher Portal.
