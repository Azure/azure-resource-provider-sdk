How do I upgrade to the new Publishing Portal?
---
If you launched your Add-on into the Azure Store before October 2013, you are most likely on the older version of the Azure Publishing Portal.  Our new Publishing Portal supports additional option to configure your Add-on and plans, and at some point all Add-ons will need to be migrated to the new Publishing Portal.

The new Publishing Portal is located at http://publish.windowsazure.com.  Follow the [Publisher Portal Guide](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/publisher-portal.md) to get started with the new Publishing Portal.
