## How do I update my Add-on logos displayed on the Azure website? 
As of December 2013 we support higher resolution Add-on logos on Azure Store pages.  To update your Add-on logos you will need to log into the [Publisher Portal](http://publish.windowsazure.com).  If you are not using the new Publisher Portal you will need to upgrade by following the steps in "How do I upgrade to the new Publisher Portal?".

1. Log into the [Publisher Portal](http://publish.windowsazure.com).
2. Select the vertical tab "App Services"
3. Select your Add-on
4. Select the horizontal tab “Marketing”
5. Select “English” or other language where relevant
6. Upload your new logos

## How do I upgrade to the new Publisher Portal?
If you launched your Add-on into the Azure Store before October 2013, you were on-boarded using an older version of the Azure Publisher Portal. Our new Publisher Portal supports additional options to configure your Add-on and associated Plans. We have automatically migrated all data from the old portal to the new portal. To get access to your existing data all you need to do is log-in with the same Live ID as the one that you used in the old portal.

Currently all data regarding your Add-on has been migrated, however some data regarding the publisher has not yet been migrated. The new portal uses the centralized Microsoft seller registration dashboard to confirm who you are as a publisher. If you do not yet have a seller profile with Microsoft (shared across Windows, Windows Phone and Azure Store) you will need to visit http://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com as part of the publishing process in the new portal to set up your Tax information and Payout information.

The new Publisher Portal is located at http://publish.windowsazure.com.  Follow the [Publisher Portal Guide](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-resource-provider-sdk/tree/master/docs/publisher-portal.md) to get started with the new Publisher Portal.
