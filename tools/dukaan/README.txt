dukaan is a handly tool for testing your Resource Provider for Windows Azure Store.

on your development computer.

To use dukaan, open your favorite shell and type ``dukaan init``. Dukaan will prompt you
for information on how to connect to your Resource Provider. Then, you can type
``dukaan create`` to start testing your Resource Provider.
